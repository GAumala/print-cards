# print-cards

Small command line program to print cards (standard size) into an A4 pdf file
using image files in your local file system. The goal is to make it easy to 
print proxies for your deck.

## Install

Use npm:

```
npm install --global @GAumala/print-cards
```

## Usage

In a terminal, just run:

```
print-cards
```

A series of prompts will let you input the image paths and other necessary data.
For best results, it is recommended that you use images with at least 600px width.
